# VueTube

VueTube is a YouTube-inspired application built with a Vue 3 frontend and a Laravel 11 backend, designed to operate with completely separate frontend and backend domains. It features full OAuth2.0 authentication and serves videos from a private server-side directory for enhanced security.

This is the frontend. [The backend is here](https://github.com/mgraichy/laravel-auth).
